This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Test Dataset. The goal is to understand the passenger demographics and identify key factors that influenced survival rates. Through this analysis, we identify data quality issues, handle missing values, and categorize features to determine the dataset's suitability for Machine Learning classification models.
